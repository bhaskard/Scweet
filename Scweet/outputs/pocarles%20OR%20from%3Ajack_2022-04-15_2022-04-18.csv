There are 100 billion galaxies in the Universe, including the Milky Way - that's where you live, buddy - which has 200 billion stars.

If you don't feel humble enough after reading this, you should read it again.

Even if you have a great brand, keep on repeating the key selling points of your pillars, again and again.

You will grow if you put your messages in front of the eyes of people who know nothing about you. What feels overused to you is new to them.

I'm testing some automation to manage my Email List.

Can someone - who's not already a Tactical Letter subscriber - can sign up via Twitter, as shown on the screenshot?

(I can remove you later, don't worry )
